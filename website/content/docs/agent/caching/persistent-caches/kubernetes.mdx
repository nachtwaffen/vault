# Vault Agent Kubernetes Persistent Cache

The `kubernetes` persistent cache configures Vault Agent persistent caching specifically for 
Kubernetes environments. This type of persistent cache requires a Kubernetes service account 
token. The service account token is used during encryption and decryption of the persistent cache 
as an additional integrity check.

The Vault Agent persistent cache file in Kubernetes should only be used for handing off Vault tokens 
and leases between initialization and sidecar Vault Agent containers. This cache file should be shared 
using a memory volume between the Vault Agent containers.

If the Vault Agent Injector for Kubernetes is being used, the persistent cache is automatically configured 
and used if the annotation `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-cache-enable: true` is set.

## Configuration

- `service_account_token_file` `(string: optional)` - When type is set to `kubernetes`, 
  this configures the path on disk where the Kubernetes service account token can be found. 
  Defaults to `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`.
